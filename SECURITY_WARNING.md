# ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING

## Insecure Development Policies Detected

The following database migration files contain **EXTREMELY PERMISSIVE** Row Level Security (RLS) policies that are **NOT SAFE FOR PRODUCTION**:

### Files with Security Issues:
1. `database_migrations/dev_add_permissive_teacher_policies.sql`
2. `database_migrations/dev_add_permissive_guruwali_policies.sql`
3. `database_migrations/dev_add_permissive_parent_policies.sql`

### What's Wrong?

These files grant unrestricted access to ALL data for specific roles:
- Teachers (roleid = 2) can read ALL user profiles, activities, comments, etc.
- Guruwali (roleid = 6) can read ALL data across the system
- Parents (roleid = 4) can read ALL student data, not just their children's

**This violates the principle of least privilege and creates serious data privacy risks.**

### Security Risks:

1. **Data Breach Risk**: Any user with teacher/parent/guruwali role can access sensitive data they shouldn't see
2. **Privacy Violations**: Parents can see other students' data, teachers can see data from other classes
3. **Compliance Issues**: Likely violates data protection regulations (GDPR, COPPA, etc.)
4. **Audit Trail**: No proper access control makes it impossible to audit who accessed what

### Immediate Actions Required:

#### Before Production Deployment:

1. **DO NOT** run these migration files in production
2. **REPLACE** with properly scoped RLS policies:
   - Teachers should only see students in their assigned class
   - Parents should only see their own children's data
   - Guruwali should only see students in their supervision scope

3. **REMOVE** the `SECURITY DEFINER` attribute from `get_my_roleid()` function or ensure it's properly secured

4. **IMPLEMENT** proper role-based access control:
```sql
-- Example: Teachers can only read students in their class
CREATE POLICY "Teachers see own class only"
ON public.user_profiles FOR SELECT
USING (
  get_my_roleid() = 2 
  AND kelas = (SELECT kelas FROM public.user_profiles WHERE userid = auth.uid())
);

-- Example: Parents can only see their linked children
CREATE POLICY "Parents see own children only"
ON public.aktivitas FOR SELECT
USING (
  get_my_roleid() = 4 
  AND userid IN (
    SELECT student_id 
    FROM public.parent_student_relations 
    WHERE parent_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

### Development vs Production:

These permissive policies may be acceptable for:
- ✅ Local development environments
- ✅ Testing environments with fake data
- ✅ Demo environments

These policies are **NEVER** acceptable for:
- ❌ Production environments
- ❌ Staging environments with real user data
- ❌ Any environment with actual student/parent/teacher data

### Checklist Before Going Live:

- [ ] Remove or rename all `dev_add_permissive_*` migration files
- [ ] Implement production-ready RLS policies with proper scoping
- [ ] Test that teachers cannot access other classes' data
- [ ] Test that parents cannot access other students' data
- [ ] Conduct security audit of all RLS policies
- [ ] Document the intended access control model
- [ ] Set up monitoring for unauthorized access attempts

### Additional Security Concerns:

1. **Environment Variables**: The login page exposes `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_SITEKEY` in client code (this is acceptable only if it's meant to be public, e.g., reCAPTCHA site key)

2. **Service Role Keys**: API routes like `/api/admin/migrate/route.ts` use service role keys which bypass RLS - ensure these endpoints are properly protected with admin authentication

3. **NPM Vulnerabilities**: Run `npm audit fix` to address moderate severity vulnerabilities in esbuild/vite dependencies
